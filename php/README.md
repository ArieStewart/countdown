# Countdown exercise in PHP

Make a kitchen timer.  Modify the `countdown()` function in [countdown.php](countdown.php) to take a number of seconds, then print each second counting down to zero.  This should be a command-line PHP application run like `php countdown.php`.

```php
countdown(10);

// should print

// 10...
// 9...
// 8...
// ...
```
